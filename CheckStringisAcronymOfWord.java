Hint
Given an array of strings words and a string s, determine if s is an acronym of words.
The string s is considered an acronym of words if it can be formed by concatenating the first character of each string in words in order. For example, "ab" can be formed from ["apple", "banana"], but it can't be formed from ["bear", "aardvark"].
Return true if s is an acronym of words, and false otherwise.
Example 1:
Input: words = ["alice","bob","charlie"], s = "abc"
Output: true
Explanation: The first character in the words "alice", "bob", and "charlie" are 'a', 'b', and 'c', respectively. Hence, s = "abc" is the acronym. 
Example 2:
Input: words = ["an","apple"], s = "a"
Output: false
Explanation: The first character in the words "an" and "apple" are 'a' and 'a', respectively. 
The acronym formed by concatenating these characters is "aa". 
Hence, s = "a" is not the acronym.*/



class Solution {
    public boolean isAcronym(List<String> words, String s) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for(String s1: words){
            sb.append(s1.charAt(0));
        }
        return sb.toString().equals(s);
    }
}
